# WaterdogPE

WaterdogPE is a brand new Minecraft: Bedrock Edition proxy software developed by the developers
of the old Waterdog Proxy. 
<br>
In this new proxy, we are working with Cloudbursts Protocol Library. It takes alot of maintaining
effort from us and provides us with a nice api to work with.
