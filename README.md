WaterdogPE is a brand new Minecraft: Bedrock Edition proxy software developed by the developers of the old Waterdog
Proxy.  
In this new proxy, we are working with Cloudbursts Protocol Library. It takes alot of maintaining effort from us and
provides us with a nice api to work with.

## Setup Guide
If you haven't used WaterdogPE before, we recommend you to take a look at our [setup guide](https://docs.waterdog.dev/books/waterdogpe-setup) in the docs.   
*Please note that the config from the old Waterdog (Bungee) is not compatible with WaterdogPE*

### Supported Software
Our goal is to support all commonly used Minecraft: Bedrock server softwares. Spoons and unofficial forks will not be supported due to the lack
of proper implementation.  
You can find list of currently supported/unsupported software [here](https://docs.waterdog.dev/books/waterdogpe-setup/page/software-compatibility).
