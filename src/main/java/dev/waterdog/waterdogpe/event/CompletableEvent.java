/**
 * Use this Annotation to when event is excepted to support complete future.
 * Completable futures are used when event should be completed later than its handlers.
 * When calling event with this Annotation, CompletableFuture<Event> will be returned and will be completed once
 * all assigned completable futures are completed.
 * Therefore eventFuture.whenComplete(futureEvent, error) should be used processing completed event.
 * It is NOT recommended to use this Annotation if event is called really often or is excepted to return result immediately.
 * Events with @AsyncEvent Annotation implements this behaviour by default.
